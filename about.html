          <h1>About me</h1>
          
          <p>This section isn't about me going ga-ga over my achievements. It is about how the journey so far has shaped
             me to a person I am today. It is about all the bits and bytes that make me. Yes I am a tech geek but with a
             difference! An equal interest in Art, Culture, Psychology and Music. I wish to see the world as if everything is a miracle.
             Firstly, I am grateful for the tiny treasure I have in my life - a roof on my head, a safe environment, a
             sustainable future, the right to education and opportunities to extract the best out of it, few but faithful
             friends and I hope to give back to society by doing my job as an IT professional.</p>

          <p>Throughout the years I have moulded myself to fight fear with hope, arrogance with confidence, thoughts with
            actions, actions with response and pessimism with optimism. I have a deep abiding love for learning, building
            and designing things. I consistently set short-term goals for myself. Then, once I’ve defined the benchmarks,
            I take necessary steps to achieve those milestones. Being tireless seeker of knowledge, I always look at where
            I can improve and strive for perfection in things which I do. I enjoy my ongoing tasks and multitasking. I
            always keep an eye on my target.</p>

            <p>I love to interact with people and share whatever little I know about my subjects and quite often can be
              found blogging on Medium.</p>

            <p>Always happy to help!</p>
